# NOISE REDUCTION PROJECT
There are exhibits with an equal number of animals. Animals only antagonize animals in exhibits within 2 exhibits of them. Animals that are antagonized generate noise. To reduce stress for the animals and pain for guests, this program attempts to find an animal order that has the least decibels sound.
